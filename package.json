  "description": "The is a project that I made for just one blog post on my site here at github pages. The goal here was to make a very simple file generator that just accepts a path and data that is then used to write a file at the path. There is more to it then that but I do not want to make the project to complicated as this project is part of what might be a collection of projects aimed at just getting to the core of a problem and being done with it.",
